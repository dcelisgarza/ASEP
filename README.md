Thank you for using our package, we hope you find it interesting and useful!

This readme file contains instructions and explanations of the parameters used in the codes.

alpha	= 	ENTRANCE rate at the LEFT boundary
eta	= 	EXIT rate at the LEFT boundary (PASEP)
beta	=	EXIT rate at the RIGHT boundary
chi	=	ENTRANCE rate at the RIGHT boundary (PASEP)
gamma	=	FORWARD hopping rate (PASEP)
delta	=	BACKWARD hopping rate (PASEP)
epsilon	=	interaction ENERGY, scaled to kbT units
theta	=	energy SPLITTING between attraction and repulsion
q	=	BINDING rate
r	=	UNBINDING rate
J	=	particle FLUX
rho	=	DENSITY
