Thank you for using our package, we hope you find it interesting and useful!

You can read the paper published as a corollary of these codes [here](http://python.rice.edu/~kolomeisky/articles/J.stat.mech_P04013.pdf). The relevant codes have not yet been released because they serve the basis for further study of increasingly complex systems at the Kolomeisky group.

This readme file contains instructions and explanations of the parameters used in the codes.

alpha	= 	ENTRANCE rate at the LEFT boundary

eta	= 	EXIT rate at the LEFT boundary (PASEP)

beta	=	EXIT rate at the RIGHT boundary

chi	=	ENTRANCE rate at the RIGHT boundary (PASEP)

gamma	=	FORWARD hopping rate (PASEP)

delta	=	BACKWARD hopping rate (PASEP)

epsilon	=	interaction ENERGY, scaled to kbT units

theta	=	energy SPLITTING between attraction and repulsion

q	=	BINDING rate

r	=	UNBINDING rate

J	=	particle FLUX

rho	=	DENSITY
